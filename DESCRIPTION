Description: Fatigue Crack Growth in Reliability estimates the distribution
             of material lifetime due to mechanical fatigue efforts. The FCGR
             package provides simultaneous crack growth curves fitting to 
             different specimens in materials under mechanical stress efforts. 
             Linear mixed-effects models (LME) with smoothing B-Splines 
             and the linearized Paris-Erdogan law are applied. Once defined
             the fail for a determined crack length, the distribution function
             of failure times to fatigue is obtained. The density function is
             estimated by applying nonparametric binned kernel density estimate 
             (bkde) and the kernel estimator of the distribution function (kde). 
             The results of Pinheiro and Bates method based on nonlinear 
             mixed-effects regression (nlme) can be also retrieved. The package 
             contains the crack.growth, PLOT.cg, IB.F, and Alea.A (database) functions.
